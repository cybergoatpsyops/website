      <description>I started my career as a troubled teen, it&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up working at the local repair shop, fixing PCs. I then joined the military after high school as there were no other options at the time. That is where I started at the Military Police as a System Administrator, then quickly pivoted into Incident response. Later in my military career, I pivoted again, but this time into special operation as a communications sergeant.</description>
